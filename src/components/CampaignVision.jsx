        <h2>Her Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Hon. Motunrayo Gbadebo-Alogba envisions a stronger, more inclusive Ijede LCDA
          where infrastructure meets innovation, and where every resident — from the youth
          to the elderly — has a voice in governance. Her vision is rooted in equity,
          development, and progress across all sectors, including education, health,
          community welfare, and economic empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through her second term, she aims to strengthen existing foundations and scale new
          heights by enhancing education access, healthcare delivery, women and youth
          empowerment, and community engagement through participatory leadership.
